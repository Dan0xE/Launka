# Quick TDU2 Launcher

## Overview

This is a small launcher for Test Drive Unlimited 2

## Requirements

- Test Drive Unlimited 2 installed on your system.
- A Windows environment.

## Setup

- Download the code from this repo.
- Ensure a text file named "path.txt" exists in the same directory as the executable. This file should contain the absolute path to your TDU2 directory (e.g., `C:\Test Drive Unlimited 2`).

## Usage

Run the executable to start the game.

## Functionality

The launcher reads the TDU2 directory path from "path.txt", starts the game, temporarily renames "steam_api.dll" to "UL_steam_api.dll", and reverts it back upon closure.
